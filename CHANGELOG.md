## Unreleased

## v6.2.0
2021-09-25
* Removed MinVersion to use the default. Windows Vista is no longer supported. This is required to
make the installer more secure on supported versions (Windows 7 updwards).
* Removed expiring DST Root CA X3 certificate so that OpenSSL and Curl will work using ISRG Root X1.

## v6.1.0
2020-09-08
* Fixed path searching to use native System32 directories on x64.
* Fixed cmd.exe invocations to use the 64-bit version on x64.
* Fixed codepage issues with cmd.exe output: https://github.com/composer/windows-setup/issues/123.

## v6.0.0
2020-08-13
* Disabled deprecation warnings in php scripts.
* Fixed PHP 8 openssl_free_key deprecation warning: https://github.com/composer/windows-setup/issues/122.
* Updated to latest installer script, including certificate data from Wed Jul 22 03:12:14 2020 GMT.
* Improved proxy handling by making proxy discovery match Composer behaviour and by reporting proxy
urls in the log file, masked to hide sensitive data.
* Fixed potential escalation of privileges by locking down the bin folder for admin installs.
* Added a path security warning which requires the user to confirm that it is their responsibilty
to ensure the access control of a folder being added or replaced on the system path. This affects
standard admin installs, but not silent or Deverloper Mode installs with admin priveleges.
* Improved and documented ini update handling.
* Fixed failures when the ini contains relative root paths, as in xampp portable, by running PHP
from the drive it is installed on and using full paths to the php scripts. This unfortunately
breaks Cygwin PHP installations. Reported in https://github.com/composer/windows-setup/issues/116.
* Fixed runphp.exe reporting PHP fatal errors by calling PHP with the -n (no ini) option, which
lets the user see the error later: https://github.com/composer/windows-setup/issues/116.
* Added cmd.exe checking to flush out misconfigrations before it is used to call the php scripts.
* Fixed missing captions on settings error page when cmd or php did not run.
* Added logging of command-line params.
* Fixed bug when admin installing in user-mode could not change global environment.
* Further improvements to Chocolatey package so it can be accepted as a core-team package.
* Fixed installer script to handle uopz extension if it prevents exit calls.

## v5.1.0
2020-01-01
* Added the identifier `Composer-Setup.exe` (plus version) to the user-agent header when downloading.
* Improved path handling to remove all instances of PHP and Composer when adding new values.
* Updated to latest installer script which fixes NO_PROXY handling bug and includes certificate data
from Wed Nov 27 04:12:10 2019 GMT.

## v5.0.0
2019-12-04
* Improved the Chocolatey package release process to use their automatic update module.
* Added the curl extension to php.ini modifications which will be needed in Composer 2.
* Updated to Inno Setup 6 which provides a modern resizable interface and drops support for Windows XP.
* Restricted PHP to 5.5 upwards because lower versions do not use the TLS protocols required to
download the installer and connect to Packagist.
* Removed the security page that allowed the user to disable TLS.
* Improved wording on environment changes page: https://github.com/composer/windows-setup/issues/103
* Updated the installer script to recognize the HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY environment variables and
to include certificate data from Wed Oct 16 03:12:09 2019 GMT.
* Improved proxy display and handling, which nows allows the user to override settings from
Internet Options: https://github.com/composer/windows-setup/issues/91
* Fixed crash caused by Inno Setup 5 bug when calling ExpandUNCFileName with a path longer than 259
characters. This occured when a user had an entry named %PATH% in their Path environment variable,
so Setup now checks for the path separator in an expanded path: https://github.com/composer/windows-setup/issues/92.
* Improved extension enabling in php.ini so that only the extension name is used for PHP7.2 upwards.
* Improved search for common PHP locations.

## v4.2.0
2016-03-24

* Allow an existing user path to be found and used in admin installs. The path is left intact but all other admin-specific locations will be used.


## v4.1.0
2016-03-24

* Major version pushed to v4, reflecting ShellMenus removal which requires uninstalling.
* Updated *userdata.dll* to handle silent uninstalls and removed the dialog cancel button, as it implied rollback functionality. File deletion can always be stopped using the dialog close icon.
* Added `/PHP=path\to\php.exe` and `/PROXY=http_proxy url` params for installation, which can additionally be saved using `/SAFEINF`
and loaded with `/LOADINF`. For uninstall `/DELETE=local` will remove only local data, while `/DELETE=all` will remove all user data.
* Added unattended/silent install and uninstall functionality, with `/SILENT`, `/VERYSILENT` and `/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES` params, as per
Inno Setup documentation.
* Changed Settings page to display a list of existing php installations. The following system drive and user profile directories are searched first: `\php*`, `\php\php*`, `\bin\php*`, `\bin\php\php*`. Then it looks for specific (xampp, wamp, PhpEd) locations.
* Simpler error handling introduced, which recognizes common PHP errors and displays all php output received.
* Added a Proxy page for the user to enter an `http_proxy` value, with a value pre-entered if a proxy is found in any registry Internet Settings. The variable is then set in the User environment (but not deleted on Uninstall). The Proxy page is also shown if `http_proxy` is already set or passed in as a param.
* Added a Security page for when openssl is disabled, with the option to not use it. Sets `disable-tls` flag for installer script
* Added installation logging, stored as `Setup Log YYYY-MM-DD #nnn.txt` in the users temp directory. For admin installs, the log is deleted on reboot.
* Removed Shell Menus feature to simplify the setup and further development.


## v3.0
2013-11-22

* Major version pushed to v3, reflecting changes below and the requirement to uninstall any existing installation.
* Added optional Shell Menus context-menu handler, to allow Composer usage from Windows Explorer/File Manager. Not available on pre-Vista.
* Added dialog requiring user to shutdown programs that are locking context-menu dll.
* Added Change feature to installer, to allow Composer reinstall and to add/remove context-menus.
* Changed installation directories to split files into application (shell, installer, uninstaller etc) and bin (composer.phar, shims) categories. For admin installs these are `<ProgramFiles>\ComposerSetup` and `%ProgramData%\ComposerSetup\bin`. For user installs these are `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ComposerSetup` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ComposerSetup\bin`. The base folder name has been changed to ComposerSetup to avoid any conflicts in the Program Files directory.
* Previous-data added: shell menus installed (key: ShellExt).
* Previous-data added: application directory (key: AppDir).
* Previous-data added: bin directory (key: BinDir).
* Code signing added to all dlls for release versions.
* Thanks to [cmenning](https://github.com/cmenning) for suggesting the context-menu handler.

* Moved released versions back to Github now they have introduced a Releases feature.
* Minor code tweaks.

## v2.7
2012-02-20

* Added an option to delete user data on uninstall. Uses a separate dll (userdata.dll) to get round Inno limitations which provides a cancellable progress form and error report. Only user data found at default locations is deleted. Config entries that point elsewhere are displayed for information but not deleted, and neither is the config.json file. Config entries at project level are not reported. For Admin uninstalls user data is shown for all users, where it can be reliably found.
* Moved User installation directory from roaming folder to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Composer\bin`. This is automatically upgraded when re-installing over an older version.
* Fixed User uninstall not updating environment.
* Previous-data added: installer version (key: Version)
* Made the repo more collaborator-friendly by moving the exe and code-signing out, re-organizing the code and adding more in-line documentation.
* Moved released versions to Amazon S3 after the demise of Github Downloads.
* Many thanks to [hakre](https://github.com/hakre) for his reports and suggestions.

## v2.6
2012-12-01

* Added proxy support. This checks for an `http_proxy` environment variable and the user's registry settings at *HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings*. It tries all the settings it finds, before falling back to a plain request. Sets `http_proxy` locally for install.phar if a proxy was used. Note that authenticated proxies are only supported using an `http_proxy` variable.
* Reworked tests to incorporate proxy support.
* Minor tweaks and doc improvements.
